Top Courses - React Project
Welcome to the "Top Courses" project!

This simple yet informative React application allows users to explore various courses 
through cards containing course names and their descriptions. Users can like or dislike courses by clicking a "like" button. 
When the like button is clicked, a toast appears to showcase the status, indicating whether the course was liked or unliked successfully.
Additionally, users can filter courses by category, such as All, Development, Business, Design, and Lifestyle. 
This project is an excellent opportunity to learn and practice basic React functionalities like fetching data from an API, 
using the useState hook, working with components, and using toast notifications.

Happy coding! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to open an issue
